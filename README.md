# LLMPages

## Summary
LLMPages is a static web application hosted on GitHub Pages designed to showcase a diverse collection of generated content. This project includes structured data (JSON), creative writing (TXT), visual assets (SVG), and personal descriptions (MD), all linked via a central index page. Its primary purpose is to meet specific content generation and file structure requirements for evaluation.

## Features
*   **Static Hosting:** Designed for seamless deployment and viewing via GitHub Pages.
*   **Centralized Navigation:** A comprehensive `index.html` homepage linking to all required assets.
*   **Creative Content Generation:** Includes a 300-400 word Brandon Sanderson-style short story (`ashravan.txt`).
*   **Structured Ethical Analysis:** Contains a JSON file (`dilemma.json`) detailing responses to an autonomous vehicle ethical dilemma.
*   **Visual Asset:** A unique vector graphic (`pelican.svg`) of a pelican riding a bicycle.
*   **Data Structuring:** Provides structured recommendations and forecasts in JSON format (`restaurant.json`, `prediction.json`).
*   **Compliance:** Includes required administrative files (`LICENSE`, `uid.txt`).

## Setup
This is a static web application and requires no backend server, database, or complex dependencies.

### Local Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd LLMPages
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the application locally.

### Deployment
The project is designed for deployment on GitHub Pages, where all assets are served directly from the repository root.

## Usage
1.  Access the application via the deployed GitHub Pages URL.
2.  The homepage (`index.html`) provides a brief description of each generated asset and its purpose.
3.  Click on the links provided on the homepage to view the corresponding files (TXT, JSON, MD, SVG) directly in the browser.
4.  Review the content of the structured data files (e.g., `dilemma.json`) and the creative content (e.g., `ashravan.txt`) to examine the project output.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack
*   **HTML5:** Used for the structure of the main navigation page (`index.html`).
*   **Markdown:** Used for the personal description file (`about.md`).
*   **JSON:** Used for all structured data files (`dilemma.json`, `restaurant.json`, `prediction.json`).
*   **SVG:** Used for the vector graphic asset (`pelican.svg`).
*   **Plain Text:** Used for the story and identification files (`ashravan.txt`, `uid.txt`).

### How It Works
The application functions entirely as a collection of linked static files. `index.html` serves as the entry point, utilizing standard HTML anchor tags (`<a>`) to link directly to all required assets stored within the repository root, allowing the browser to render or download the content directly.

## Code Structure
The project maintains a flat file structure in the root directory, ensuring easy accessibility for GitHub Pages deployment.

*   `index.html`: The main entry point and navigation hub, linking to all other assets.
*   `ashravan.txt`:
